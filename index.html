        <h2>Where a gnome can find a home</h2>
        <p>
            Here at <span class="gnomaPalooza">GnomaPalooza Old Gnome Sanctuary</span>, we care immensely for each and
            every garden-dwelling friend that comes through our doors. Our family is committed to providing only the best
            care: With diets, training, and living quarters formulated by gnome experts across the globe. Though we specialize
            in taking care of gnomes in need, gnomes of any age and background are welcome in <span class="gnomaPalooza">GnomaPalooza Old Gnome Sanctuary</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
            Founded in 2013, our staff is comprised of gnome-lovers and enthusiasts. <span class="gnomaPalooza">GnomaPalooza Old Gnome Sanctuary</span> was created with one idea in mind: to give care to those gnomes who need it. Gnomes can generally take care of themselves in the wild, but too often are domesticated gnomes left uncared for and unable to fend for themselves. Old or otherwise "undesirable" gnomes are also abandoned quite often. This is where we come in.

            Meet some of our staff below!

                    Kaitlyn has been with <span class="gnomaPalooza">GnomaPalooza</span> since its beginning! As one of our founders, there's no surprise that she has an endless supply of love and care for every gnome and is excellent at communicating with them. Definitely one of our gnome's favorite caretakers, for good reason.

                    The other founder of <span class="gnomaPalooza">GnomaPalooza</span>, Joey, has never come across a gnome in need that he wasn't able to help. In addition, Joey handles most of the marketing and has done so since our founding. Whether it's business needs or a gnome in distress, he's sure to get the job done!
