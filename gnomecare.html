            <h2>Gnome Care</h2>
            <p>
                Every breed of gnome has its own special requirements and accommodations. Despite this, there are a few basic rules of thumb any prospective gnome owner should follow. That's why we've put together a general list to get started with! <br> <br>
                You'll want to focus on:
            </p>
            <ul id="careList">
                <li>Habitat</li>
                <li>Diet</li>
                <li>Grooming</li>
                <li>Socialization</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Habitat</dt>
                <dd>
                    Gnomes in the wild rarely like to be seen. For this reason, you'll need to provide your gnome with plenty of hiding places. This can be anything: extra shrubbery, large toadstools, or even store-bought gnome houses do the trick!
                </dd>
                <dt>Diet</dt>
                <dd>
                    Aside from a few exceptions, gnomes typically eat fruits and vegetables. It is fine to feed your gnome grains once in a while, but heavy diet of this will likely upset your little buddy's stomach, so we recommend you avoid this. Unless your gnome bears sharp teeth, it does not need meat.
                </dd>
                <dt>Grooming</dt>
                <dd>
                    With fur like that, the majority of gnomes need their beards brushed and trimmed at least once a month! This is commonly looked over. The course hair of their beards can easily get tangled and matted, and if left to grow too long, they may start tripping over their beards.
                </dd>
                <dt>Socialization</dt>
                <dd>
                    Gnomes live in what we call "villages" in the wild. These villages contain anywhere between 5 to 60 gnomes! While we aren't encouraging you to adopt in bulk, it's a good idea to have at least two gnomes so they can socialize. Gnomes are very intelligent, and will become depressed if they lack interaction with other gnomes.
